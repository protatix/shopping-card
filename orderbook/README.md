# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# bitholla-javascript-test

The main goal of this project develop a ReactJS application which connects to BitMEX orderbook L2 through websocket and displays the live orderbook

## Description

I use orderBookL2 subscription through websocket. When the state gets all the order records first then marketReducer handles updated,deleted and insterted data. I made folder structure as much as simple. You can check components, context, layout, utils and reducers in the src folder. The packages such as styled-components has been inserted into the assignment.

This website supports mobile devices.

## Usage

```bash
  yarn start
```
